Version 0.1
Welcome! Welcome to the first game in a series of official
modifications to the plot of the Electron camp
You play as one of those people who erased their previous life, and
put the memories of "Vanya", and then threw them on one of the cycles (shifts).
After each shift, the protagonist's old memories are erased, and he
goes to the next cycle, but not ours. He remembers the previous ones
cycles, understands that the camp is not real, and at the same time understands that the chances
he doesn't have a chance to get out into the real world. However! suddenly, the universe that our
main character, as he believed, had studied, begins to work not as it should.
One thing is clear, in some of the cycles there was a failure, which means that an
exit to the real world was formed.
