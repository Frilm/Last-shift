 <h1>Last Shift</h1>
 
 Version 0.1

Welcome! Welcome to the first game in a series of official modifications to the plot of the camp "Electron"

 You play as one of those people who had their previous life erased, and they put the memories of "Vanya", and then threw them into one of the cycles (shifts).
After each shift, the protagonist's old memories are erased, and he is sent to the next cycle, but not ours.
He remembers the previous cycles, understands that the camp is not real, and at the same time understands that he has no chance to get out into the real world.
However! suddenly the universe, which our protagonist, as he defended, studied, begins to work not as it should.
One thing is clear, in some of the cycles there was a failure, which means that an exit to the real world was also formed.
